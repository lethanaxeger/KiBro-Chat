Me and my friend made this web-based application for Final Practice in my university. So while learning how to use flet Framework I decided to commit it in my github.. it isn't a bad idea, hm?

##What does this do?
KiBro or 'Kita Ngobrol' is a web-based chatting platform using flet framework. It only sending a text message only. It's just basic websocket program that run in flet Framework with enchance UI develop.

##using HTML and CSS
We already try to using it and we decide to search something more simple than complicated by making 3 different extensions code. It makes way easier and faster than developing using HTML and CSS with python for the back-end programm.

##How to use this?
This program works in python enviroment using flet as Framework. It's pretty easy and you can develop it whenever you want by adding some extras to make it super-chat-web-app. This program runs at client side but need to run the server first. Don't worry, it will run by change a bit in server.py and c_socket.py

You can use this code by:
- Cloning this repository
  > git clone https://github.com/lethanaxeger/Kibro-Chat
  
- Change you directory to Kibro-Chat (Change the ppath] following where the Kibro-Chat is saved)
  > cd [path]\Kibro-Chat
  
- Change the port in c_socket.py as you like
  > ![port_c_socket](https://github.com/lethanaxeger/KiBro-Chat/assets/53499521/8144fe33-3a06-4839-9931-a8b47e84a516)
  
- Run the server.py first
  > py .\server.py
  
- Run the main.py
  > py .\main.py

Voila!, KiBro is running in your web. You can use it in any devices. Just access the IP following with the same PORT.
  
###If you're using python instead py, just change it to python
